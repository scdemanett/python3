# python3

This is a set of scripts to package a DroboApp from scratch, i.e., download sources, unpackage, compile, install, and package in a TGZ file. The `master` branch contains the Drobo5N version, the `drobofs` branch contains the DroboFS version.

## I just want to install the DroboApp, what do I do?

Check the [releases](https://github.com/droboports/python3/releases) page. If there are no releases available, then you have to compile.

## How to compile

First make sure that you have a [working cross-compiling VM](https://github.com/droboports/droboports.github.io/wiki/Setting-up-a-VM).

Log in the VM, pick a temporary folder (e.g., `~/build`), and then do:

```
git clone https://github.com/droboports/python3.git
cd python3
./build.sh
ls -la *.tgz
```

Each invocation creates a log file with all the generated output.

* `./build.sh distclean` removes everything, including downloaded files.
* `./build.sh clean` removes everything but downloaded files.
* `./build.sh package` repackages the DroboApp, without recompiling.

## Build a cross-compiler

First, install the package `qemu-user-static`.

Then, make sure there are no residual files, and use the `BUILD_DEST` variable.
```
./build.sh clean
XPYTHON="${HOME}/xtools/python3/5n"
BUILD_DEST="${XPYTHON}" ./build.sh
cp -vfaR ./target/install/bin/* "${XPYTHON}/bin/"
cp -vfaR ./target/install/include/* "${XPYTHON}/include/"
```

And set the `QEMU_LD_PREFIX` to use the python cross-compiler.
```
. crosscompile.sh
QEMU_LD_PREFIX="${TOOLCHAIN}/${HOST}/libc" "${XPYTHON}/bin/python" setup.py build_ext \
  --include-dirs="${XPYTHON}/include" --library-dirs="${XPYTHON}/lib" \
  --force build --force bdist_egg --dist-dir .
```

## Missing modules

```
Python build finished, but the necessary bits to build these modules were not found:
_tkinter           bsddb185           gdbm            
linuxaudiodev      ossaudiodev        readline        
sunaudiodev                                           
To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.
```
